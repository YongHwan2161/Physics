# Entropy and Shannon's Information Theory
- Shannon quantified this by taking the base 2 logarithm of the probability of a given message occuring. That is, if we denote the information content of a message by $I$, and the probability of its occurrence by $p$, then $$I=-\log_2{p}$$
- The negative sign ensures that the information content of a message is positive, and that the less probable a message, the higher is the information content.
- A message that is unlikely to occur has a low probability an therefore has a large information content.
- A message that is very likely to occur has a high probability and therefore has a small information content.
- Next let's develop a more formal definition. Let $X$ be a random variable characterized by a probability distribution $\vec{p}$, and suppose that it can assume one of the values $x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n$ with probabilities $p_1,p_2,\cdots,p_n$. Probabilities satisfy $0\le p_i\le 1$ and $\sum_i p_i=1$.
