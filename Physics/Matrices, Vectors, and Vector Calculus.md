# Concept of a Scalar
Quantities that are 'invariant under coordinate transformation'-those that obey an equation of this type- are termed **scalars**
 Although we can describe the mass of a particle (or the temperature, or the speed, etc.) relative to any coordinate system by the same number, some physical properties associated with the particle (such as the direction of motion of the particle or the direction of a force that may act on the particle) cannot be specified in such a simple manner. The description of these more complicated quantities requires the use of **vectors**. Just as a scalar is defined as a quantity that remains invariant under a coordinate transformation, a vector may also be difined in terms of transformation properties. We begin by considering how the coordinates of a point change when the coordinate system rotates around its origin.
