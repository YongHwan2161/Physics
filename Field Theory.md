# GF(2)
- GF(2) is the field with the smallest possible number of elements, and is unique if the additive identity and the multiplicative identity are denoted respectively 0 and 1, as usual.
- $$\begin{array}{c|cc}
+ & 0 & 1 \\
\hline
0 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 1
\end{array}$$
- If the elements of GF(2) are seen as Boolean values, then the addition is the same as that of the logical XOR operation. Since each element equals its opposite, subtraction is thus the same operation as addition.
- The multiplication of GF(2) is again the usual multiplication modulo 2(see the table below), and on Boolean variables corresponds to the logical AND operation.
- $$\begin{array}{c|cc}
\times & 0 & 1 \\
\hline
0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1
\end{array}$$
