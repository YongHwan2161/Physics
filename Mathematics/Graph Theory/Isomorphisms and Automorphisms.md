# Isomorphisms
- Two graphs $G$ and $H$ are identical, written $G=H$, if $V(G)=V(H), E(G)=E(H)$, and $\psi_G=\psi_H$. If two graphs are identical, they can clearly be represented by identical diagrams. However, it is also possible for graphs that are not identical to have essentially the same diagram. For example, the graph $G$ and $H$ in [[Isomorphisms and Automorphisms#fig 1.6|Fig 1.6]] can be represented by diagrams which look exactly the same, as the second drawing of $H$ shows; the sole difference lies in the labels of their vertices and edges. Although the graph $G$ and $H$ are not identical, they do have identical structures, and are said to be isomorphic.

- In general, two gaphs $G$ and $H$ are *isomorphic*, written $G\cong H$, if there are bijections $\theta:V(G)\to V(H)$ and $\phi:E(G)\to E(H)$ such that $\psi_G(e)=uv$ if and only if $\psi_H(\phi(e))=\theta(u)\theta(v)$; such a pair of mappings is called an *isomorphism* between $G$ and $H$.
- In order to show that two graphs are isomophic, one must indicate an isomorphism between them. The pair of mappings $(\theta, \phi)$ defined by $$\theta:=\left(\begin{array}{}a &b&c&d\\w&z&y&x\end{array}\right), \phi:=\left(\begin{array}{}e_1&e_2&e_3&e_4&e_5&e_6\\f_3&f_4&f_1&f_6&f_5&f_2\end{array}\right)$$ is isomorphism between the graphs $G$ and $H$ in [[Isomorphisms and Automorphisms#fig 1.6|Figure 1.6]].
## Isomorphism in simple graphs
- In the case of simple graphs, the definition of isomorphism can be stated more concisely, because if $(\theta, \phi)$ is an isomorphism between simple graphs $G$ and $H$, the mapping $\phi$ is completely determined by $\theta$; indeed, $\phi(e)=\theta(u)\theta(v)$ for any edge $e=uv$ of $G$. Thus one may define an isomorphism between two simple graphs $G$ and $H$ as a bijection $\theta: V(G)\to V(H)$ which preserves adjacency (that is, the vertices $u$ and $v$ are adjacent in $G$ if and only if their images $\theta(u)$ and $\theta(v)$ are adjacent in $H$).
- Consider, for example, the graphs $G$ and $H$ in [[Isomorphisms and Automorphisms#Figure 1.7|Figure 1.7]] 
###### Figure 1.7

The mapping$$\theta:=\left(\begin{array}{}1&2&3&4&5&6\\b&d&f&c&e&a\end{array}\right)$$ is an isomorphism between $G$ and $H$, as is $$\theta':=\left(\begin{array}{}1&2&3&4&5&6\\a&c&e&d&f&b\end{array}\right)$$
- Isomorphic graphs clearly have the same numbers of vertices and edges. On the other hand, equality of these parameters does not guarantee isomorphism. For instance, the two graphs shown in [[Isomorphisms and Automorphisms#Figure 1.8|Figure 1.8]] both have eight vertices and twelve edges, but they are not isomorphic. To see this, observe that the graph $G$ has four mutually nonadjacent vertices, $v_1, v_3, v_6, \text{ and } v_8$ of $H$ would like mutually nonadjacent. But it can readily be checked that no four vertices of $H$ are mutually nonadjacent. We deduce that $G$ and $H$ are not isomorphic.

- It is clear from the foregoing discussion that if two graphs are isomorphic, then they are either identical or differ merely in the names of their vertices and edges, and thus have the same structure. Because it is primarily in structural properties that we are interested, we often omit labels when drawing graphs; formally, we may define an *unlabelled graph* as a representative of an equivalence class of isomorphic graphs. We assign labels to vertices and edges in a graph mainly for the purpose of referring to them (in proofs, for instance).
- Up to isomorphism, there is just one complete graph on $n$ vertices, denoted $K_n$. Similarly, given two positive integers $m$ and $n$, there is a unique complete bipartite graph with parts of sizes $m$ and $n$, there is a unique complete bipartite graph with parts of sizes $m$ and $n$, (again, up to isomorphism), denoted $K_{m, n}$. In this notation, the graphs in [[Graphs and Their Representation#Figure 1.2|Figure 1.2]] are $K_5, K_{3,3}$, and $K_{1,5}$, respectively. Likewise, for any positive integer $n$, there is a unique path on $n$ vertices and a unique cycle on $n$ vertices. These graphs are denoted $P_n$ and $C_n$, respectively. The graphs depicted in [[Graphs and Their Representation#Figure 1.3|Figure 1.3]] and $P_4$ and $C_5$.
## Testing for Isomorphism
- Given two graphs on $n$ vertices, it is certainly possible in principle to determine whether are isomorphic. For instance, if $G$ and $H$ are simple, one could just consider each of the $n!$ bijections between $V(G)$ and $V(H)$ in turn, and check whether it is an isomorphism between the two grpahs. If the graphs happen to be isomorphic, an isomorphism might (with luck) be found quickly. On the other hand, if they are not isomorphic, one would need to check all $n!$ bijections to discover this fact. Unfortunately, even for moderately small values of $n$ (such as $n=100$), the number $n!$ is unmanageably large (indeed, larger than the number of particles in the universe!), so this 'brute force' approach is not feasible. Of course, if the graphs are not regular, the number of bijections to be checked will be smaller, as an isomorphism must map each vertex to a vertex of the same degree (Exercise 1.2.1a). Nonetheless, except in particular cases, this restriction does not serve to reduce their number sufficiently. Indeed, no efficient generally applicable procedure for testing isomorphism is known. However, by employing powerful group-theoretic methods, Luks (1982) devised an efficient isomorphism-testing algorithm for cubic graphs and, more generally, for graph of bounded maximum degree.
- There is another important matter related to algorithmic questions such as graph isomorphism. Suppose that two simple graphs $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic. It might not be easy to find an isomorphism between them, but once such an isomorphism $\theta$ has been found, it is a simple matter to verify that $\theta$ is indeed an isomorphism: one need merely check that, for each of the $\binom{n}{2}$ pairs $uv$ of vertices of $G$, $uv\in E(G)$ if and only if $\theta{u}\theta{v}\in E(H)$. On the other hand, if $G$ and $H$ happen not to be isomorphic, how can one verify this fact, short of checking all possible bijections between $V(G)$ and $V(H)$? In certain case, one might be able to show that $G$ and $H$ are not isomorphic by isolating some structural property of $G$ that is not shared by $H$ are not isomorphic by isolating some structural property of $G$ that is not shared by $H$, as we did for the graphs $G$ and $H$ of Figure 1.8. However, in general, verifying that two nonisomorphic graphs are indeed not isomorphic seems to be just as hard as determining in the first place whether they are isomorphic or not.
