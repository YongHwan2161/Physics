# Isomorphisms
- Two graphs $G$ and $H$ are identical, written $G=H$, if $V(G)=V(H), E(G)=E(H)$, and $\psi_G=\psi_H$. If two graphs are identical, they can clearly be represented by identical diagrams. However, it is also possible for graphs that are not identical to have essentially the same diagram. For example, the graph $G$ and $H$ in [[Isomorphisms and Automorphisms#fig 1.6|Fig 1.6]] can be represented by diagrams which look exactly the same, as the second drawing of $H$ shows; the sole difference lies in the labels of their vertices and edges. Although the graph $G$ and $H$ are not identical, they do have identical structures, and are said to be isomorphic.

- In general, two gaphs $G$ and $H$ are *isomorphic*, written $G\cong H$, if there are bijections $\theta:V(G)\to V(H)$ and $\phi:E(G)\to E(H)$ such that $\psi_G(e)=uv$ if and only if $\psi_H(\phi(e))=\theta(u)\theta(v)$; such a pair of mappings is called an *isomorphism* between $G$ and $H$.
- In order to show that two graphs are isomophic, one must indicate an isomorphism between them. The pair of mappings $(\theta, \phi)$ defined by $$\theta:=\left(\begin{array}{}a &b&c&d\\w&z&y&x\end{array}\right), \phi:=\left(\begin{array}{}e_1&e_2&e_3&e_4&e_5&e_6\\f_3&f_4&f_1&f_6&f_5&f_2\end{array}\right)$$ is isomorphism between the graphs $G$ and $H$ in [[Isomorphisms and Automorphisms#fig 1.6|Figure 1.6]].
## Isomorphism in simple graphs
- In the case of simple graphs, the definition of isomorphism can be stated more concisely, because if $(\theta, \phi)$ is an isomorphism between simple graphs $G$ and $H$, the mapping $\phi$ is completely determined by $\theta$; indeed, $\phi(e)=\theta(u)\theta(v)$ for any edge $e=uv$ of $G$. Thus one may define an isomorphism between two simple graphs $G$ and $H$ as a bijection $\theta: V(G)\to V(H)$ which preserves adjacency (that is, the vertices $u$ and $v$ are adjacent in $G$ if and only if their images $\theta(u)$ and $\theta(v)$ are adjacent in $H$).
- Consider, for example, the graphs $G$ and $H$ in
