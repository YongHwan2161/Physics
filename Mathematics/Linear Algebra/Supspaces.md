# 1.33 definition: subspace
- A subset $U$ of $V$ is called a *subspace*of $V$ if $U$ is also a vector space with the same additive identity, addition, and scalar multiplication as on $V$.
# 1.34 conditions for a subspace
- A subset $U$ of $V$ is a subspace of $V$ if and only if $U$ satisfies the following three conditions.
- **additive identity**:
  - $0\in U$.
- **closed under addition**:
  - $u,w\in U$ implies $u+w\in U$.
- **closed under scalar multiplication**:
  - $a\in\mathbf{F}$ and $u\in U$ implies $au\in U$.
- **Proof**: If $U$ is a subspace of $V$, then $U$ satisfies the three conditions above by the definition of vector space.
- Conversely, suppose $U$ satisfies the three conditions above. The first condition ensures that the additive identity of $V$ is in $U$. The second condition ensures that addition makes sense on $U$. The third condition ensures that scalar multiplication makes sense on $U$.
