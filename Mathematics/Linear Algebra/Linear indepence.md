- In the theory of vector spaces, a set of vectors is said to be linearly independent if there exists no nontrivial linear combination of the vectors that equals the zero vector. If such a linear combination exists, then the vectors are said to be linearly dependent. These concepts are central to the definition of dimension.

# Definition
- A sequence of vectors $\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \cdots, \mathbf{v}_k$ from a vector space $V$ is said to be linearly dependent, if there exist scalars $a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_k$, not all zero, such that $$a_1\mathbf{v}_1+a_2\mathbf{v}_2+\cdots+a_k\mathbf{v}_k=\mathbf{0}$$
- where $\mathbf{0}$ denotes the zero vector.
