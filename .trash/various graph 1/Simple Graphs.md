## Simple Graph
- A graph is *simple* if it has no loops or parallel edges. The graph $H$ in [[Graphs and Their Representation#Figure 1.1.|fig. 1.1]] is simple, whereas the graph $G$ in [[Graphs and Their Representation#Figure 1.1.|fig. 1.1]] is not. Much of graph theory is concerned with the study of simple graphs.
- The maximum number of edges in a simple graph on $n$ vertices occurs when every pair of distinct vertices is joined by exactly one edge.
- Such a graph, in which every pair of distinct vertices is adjacent, is called the [[Graphs and Their Representation#complete graph|complete graph]] on $n$ vertices, denoted $\mathbf{K}_n$.
- A set $V$, together with a set $E$ of two-element subsets of V, defines a simple graph $(V, E)$, where the ends of an edge $uv$ are precisely the vertices $u$ and $v$. Indeed, in any simple graph we may dispense with the incidence function $\psi$ by renaming each edge as the unordered pair of its ends. In a diagram of such a graph, the labels of the edges may then be omitted.
